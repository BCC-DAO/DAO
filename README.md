# DAO

Welcome to the BCC-DAO project, an exciting initiative developed by the Blockchain Center Community (BCC) at the University of Zurich. This repository serves as the development hub for our DAO, which is tailored to be deployed on a standard fork of Ethereum, operated by the university.

The backbone of our DAO is the powerful governor contract developed by [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/). The governor contract plays a pivotal role in enforcing the rules and regulations within our DAO, ensuring transparency and accountability in decision-making processes.

To foster democratic participation, we have implemented ERC721 compliant tokens for voting purposes. These tokens provide a secure and verifiable method for participants to cast their votes and shape the future of the community.

We invite all members of the community to actively participate in the development and growth of the BCC-DAO project.
